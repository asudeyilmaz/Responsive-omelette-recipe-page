## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned



```html

```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display:contents;
  ----
tr:last-child 
	border-bottom: none;
  ----
  ::marker;

```


### Continued development

I'm thinking of improving page centering in CSS.


### Useful resources

- [](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me for "display:contents" reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
